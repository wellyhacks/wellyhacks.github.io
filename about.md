### Frequently Asked Questions

Who can sign up? Where do I sign up? When is it?

----------------------

Any high school student is eligible to sign up, but spaces are very limited. People who have never done a hackathon before may be prioritised so they can gain experience. It will be on November 23 and 24th. 

What will I need to bring?

----------------------

Your laptop, chargers, anything for your hack (hardware? a keyboard?), and an open mind.

How much does it cost?

----------------------

Nothing! It's free!! Yay! We’ll have snacks, and beverages onsite at the hackathon, as well as swag, prizes, and fun mini-events.

Who is judging?

---------------

Judging is done by the people that matter the most– attendees. If you ship a project you can vote on other projects. 

I'm not that good at coding...

------------------------------

This hackathon is for hackers of all skill levels! We'll have workshops and other events so join us and let's learn together. If you'd like to start exploring some introductory projects, check out Hack Club Workshops.

What can I make?

----------------

Anything! Board games, VR games, platformers, puzzle hunts, apps, websites, anything and everything is game. Create away!

My parents are worried!
